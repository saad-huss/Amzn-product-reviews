# Amazon Product Review Text Classification with DL
This was my final project for CP8319 (Introduction to Deep Learning), where I employed LSTM-variants to perform various binary and multi-class classification tasks on an Amazon Product Review dataset obtained from Kaggle.

The final report contains further details on the dataset, processing techniques, methodology and results. The final project code will be added shortly.
